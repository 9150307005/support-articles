<p>Running the Android emulator is not currently supported on CircleCI, since it's not supported by the type of virtualization CircleCI uses on Linux. Some users have reported success with Android emulators on the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/executor-types/#using-macos" target="_self">macOS executor</a>, but there are many caveats and success with route depends on your application. Therefor we cannot provide support assistance for users attempting this route, and we recommend using an external service such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/test-lab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Test Lab</a> to run your emulator tests from your CircleCI job.</p>
<p>The gcloud tools are preinstalled on the CircleCI Docker images for Android - see the <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/android/images" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dockerfiles here</a> and <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/circleci/android/tags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Docker Hub links here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: W<span>e now have an Android machine image available in preview that supports x86 emulators. Documentation on how to access it is available here: </span><a class="" href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/android-image-preview-docs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/android-image-preview-docs</a></p>
