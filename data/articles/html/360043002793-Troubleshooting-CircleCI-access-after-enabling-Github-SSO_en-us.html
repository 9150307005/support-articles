<p>When you enable SSO old OAuth tokens are not safelisted for use, so you will need to re-create them after enabling SSO with the following steps:</p>
<ul dir="auto" type="disc">
    <li type="disc">user logs in to the affected org on GitHub using SSO.</li>
    <li type="disc">user goes to OAuth application settings,Â <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications" rel="noreferrer">https://github.com/settings/applications</a>, selects CircleCI token, revokes it</li>
    <li type="disc">user goes to circleci.com, logs out if necessary, logs in again, which should request authorization, makes sure CircleCI is authorized to access the org</li>
</ul>
