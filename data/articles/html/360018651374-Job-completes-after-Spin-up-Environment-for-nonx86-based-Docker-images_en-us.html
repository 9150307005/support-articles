<p>Images based on the ARM architecture, such as <span>Raspberry Pi</span> images, can't natively run on an x86-based host which is what CircleCI uses.Â </p>
<p>The binary files compiled for ARM-based images are not compatible with our hardware. Therefore, and so we will fail to communicate with the image once the Docker container is executed.<br><br>If you are developing for ARM, please tell us about it on <a href="https://ideas.circleci.com/ideas/CCI-I-900" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this CircleCI Ideas page</a>.</p>
