<p>The following error message is usually related to running out of memory during a job:</p>
<pre class="css-1hjuxmj">Failed to minify the bundle. Error: static/js/12.fb78ba11.chunk.js from Terser
Error: Call retries were exceeded</pre>
<p>There are a couple of options to resolve this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Increase the <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker-executor" target="_self">resource class</a> in use to provide more memory to the job</li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009208393-How-can-I-increase-the-max-memory-for-Node-" target="_self">Adjust the "max_old_space_size" for NodeJS to a suitable value</a>. For example, if you are using the medium resource class with 4GB of memory, then set this to 3GB.
