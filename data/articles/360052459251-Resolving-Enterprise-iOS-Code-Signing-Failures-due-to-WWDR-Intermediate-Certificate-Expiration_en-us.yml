  <p>Enterprise signing for iOS apps may start failing from 2 September 2020 due
  to code-signing requiring the new, updated WWDR Intermediate Certificate. Many
  of the Xcode images that CircleCI provides were created before the new
  certificate was issued and as such require the certificate to be installed
  during the job. More information about the WWDR Intermediate Certificate
  expiration can be found <a
  href="https://developer.apple.com/support/expiration/" target="_self">on
  Apple's developer support website</a></p>

  <p>Currently, Fastlane and Xcode do not handle this correctly for the CircleCI
  environment and in most cases attempting Enterprise iOS code signing will
  fail.</p>

  <p>To mitigate this, please add the following steps to your job to download
  and install the new certificate into the system keychain:</p>

  <pre>- run: curl https://www.apple.com/certificateauthority/AppleWWDRCAG3.cer
  -o AppleWWDRCAG3.cer<br>- run: sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot
  -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain AppleWWDRCAG3.cer</pre>
