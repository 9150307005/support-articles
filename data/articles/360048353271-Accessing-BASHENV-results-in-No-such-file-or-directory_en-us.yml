  <p>The $BASH_ENV environment variable holds a string that holds the location
  of a file in the /tmp directory. This is used to pass values between steps in
  a CircleCI Job.</p>

  <p>Typically this is appended to and created within the same step</p>

  <pre>- run: echo "export MY_ENV_VAR=example" &gt;&gt; $BASH_ENV</pre>

  <p>If a build tries to access that value before it has been created it will
  result in a not found error</p>

  <pre>- run: cat $BASH_ENV</pre>

  <pre>cat: /tmp/.bash_env-5f3d6eeXXXXXXXa54XXXX-0-build: No such file or
  directory</pre>

  <p>The solution can be to either make sure to run at least one step that
  appends values to the file listed in $BASH_ENV or to simply touch the file</p>

  <pre>- run: touch $BASH_ENV</pre>
