  <p>The <a
  href="https://circleci.com/blog/announcing-new-insights-endpoints-in-circleci-s-api-v2/"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insights API endpoints</a> allow you to pull
  information about workflows and jobs, there are several endpoints outlined
  here:</p>

  <p><a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#tag/Insights">https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#tag/Insights</a></p>

  <p>There are a few caveats when utilizing these endpoints where you may find
  the response you receive back isn't what you are expecting.</p>

  <h2>Not specifying a <code>branch</code> parameter</h2>

  <p>The Insights endpoints are scoped to branches, and if you don't pass a
  branch parameter we will pull the data for the default branch of your
  project.</p>

  <h2>The workflow is currently "On-Hold"</h2>

  <p>We will only return data for workflows that have moved to an "end" state --
  i.e. "Success", "Failed", "Cancelled".</p>

  <p>Since an "On-Hold" workflow is technically still running, the workflow and
  job data associated with it will not be returned.</p>

  <h2>The workflow was started by a tag</h2>

  <p>At the moment we will only return data from the Insights endpoints if the
  workflow was started from a branch. Any workflow that was started by a tag
  will not be returned in the API responses.</p>
