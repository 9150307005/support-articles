body: "<p dir=\"auto\">When an org is added to a shared plan (that is, using the plan of another org), the frontend-private UI can \"overlay\" contexts from the parent organization's plan to other organizations that are a part of the same plan.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>In the simplest case</strong>, this can make a user think they've created a context in their organization where it's really in the parent. In more complex cases, they may have a context of the same name in both organizations, but with different environment variables.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Workaround</strong>: Please create context through <strong>new UI</strong> and use the same for viewing. New UI can be accessed at:\_</p>\n<p><strong>GitHub</strong>:\_https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/github/&lt;ORG_NAME&gt;/</p>\n<p><strong>BitBucket</strong>:\_<a href=\"https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/bitbucket/&lt;ORG_NAME&gt;/\">https://app.circleci.com/settings/organization/bitbucket/&lt;ORG_NAME&gt;/</a></p>\n<p>You can find instructions additional information about <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/#creating-and-using-a-context\" target=\"_self\">Creating and Using Context\_</a>in our docs.\_</p>"
