body: "<p>When installing a Homebrew package that depends on Python 3, or when installing Python 3 itself, you may run in to the following error:</p>\n<pre class=\"output\"><span class=\"pre\"><span class=\"white\"><span class=\"red\">Error:</span> The `brew link` step did not complete successfully\nThe formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local\nCould not symlink Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers\nTarget /usr/local/Frameworks/Python.framework/Headers\nis a symlink belonging to python@2.</span></span></pre>\n<p>This error occurs due to the <a href=\"https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/49796\" target=\"_self\">removal of Python 2 from Homebrew</a>. Previously, Python 3 would be linked as \"python3\", but now it will be linked as \"python\" which overrides the previous Python 2 version.</p>\n<p>If you receive this error, you will need to add the following step <em>before</em>\_installing any Homebrew packages:</p>\n<pre>- run: brew unlink python@2</pre>\n<p>Note: From the Xcode 11.4 image onwards, we no longer ship Python 2 with the image.</p>"
