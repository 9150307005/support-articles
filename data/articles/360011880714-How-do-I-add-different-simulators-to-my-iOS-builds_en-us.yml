body: "<p>The Xcode images are preinstalled with recent versions of the simulator runtime. A list of the simulator runtimes, along with simulator devices, can be found in the <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/testing-ios/#supported-xcode-versions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">image manifest</a>.\_</p>\n<h3>Adding a simulator runtime</h3>\n<p>If a different simulator runtime is required for your tests, you can use the <a href=\"https://github.com/xcpretty/xcode-install\" target=\"_self\">xcode-install</a> gem to download these within your job. For example:</p>\n<pre>-run: gem install xcode-install<br>-run: xcversion simulators --install=\"13.2\" --no-progress</pre>\n<p>Please note that downloading additional simulator runtimes may increase build times.</p>\n<h3>Creating a new simulator</h3>\n<p dir=\"auto\">If you need to create a specific simulator combination that is not provided by default, you can create these with the <code>xcrun simctl create</code> command. An example may look like this:</p>\n<pre dir=\"ltr\">-run: xcrun simctl create 'iPhone 11 (13.2)' com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-11 com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-13-2</pre>"
