  <p>If you are trying to use Test Splitting with
  <code>mocha-junit-reporter</code> and running into the following message:</p>

  <pre>Error autodetecting timing type, falling back to weighting by name. 

  Autodetect no matching filename or classname.</pre>

  <p>It likely is related to the filenames not being in the proper format in the
  XML file. There is an open issue with a workaround here that will allow this
  to work with CircleCI:</p>
