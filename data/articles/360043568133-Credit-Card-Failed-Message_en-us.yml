body: "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A failed credit card transaction could be due to insufficient funds, an expired or cancelled card, or the bank declining the charge for some other reason. </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there were insufficient funds, please increase the limit on the card. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is expired or cancelled, update the card in your billing portal by clicking on the “Manage Billing and Statements” button on your Plan overview page and click <strong>“Update Payment Method.”</strong> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The charge will automatically retry when you update the card on file. If you take action for the card that does not include updating the credit card on file, open a support ticket to request the retry, or wait 1-2 days for it to retry automatically.\_</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.slack.com/files-pri/T02519B3Z-FU8032U4F/screen_shot_2020-02-12_at_3.30.35_pm.png\"><br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it was not one of those reasons, we suggest getting in touch with your bank for more details about the nature of the decline.\_</span></p>"
