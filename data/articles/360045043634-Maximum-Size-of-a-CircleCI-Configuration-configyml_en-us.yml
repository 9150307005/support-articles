body: "<p>The maximum size of a CircleCI configuration file(config.yml) is 3MB. When this limit is exceeded, customers may see errors such as \"<strong>Unexpected exception processing config\"</strong> or \"<strong>An compiled config YAML must be at most 3MB\"</strong> or \"<strong><span>Error: Your config (including expanded orbs) is too large. Please contact support.\"</span></strong>\_in their build logs</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that this is the\_<em>compiled</em> configuration. This is the result of expanding any YAML anchors and aliases as well as expanding any included Orbs.</p>"
