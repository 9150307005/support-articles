  <p>If your iOS app crashes in the Simulator during a test run, the crash
  report can be used for diagnosing the exact cause of the crash.</p>

  <p>By default, the crash reports for the app will be written to the
  ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports directory.</p>

  <p>The crash reports can be uploaded as artifacts to assist with debugging the
  app crash on your local machine:</p>

  <pre>- store_artifacts:<br>    path: ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</pre>
