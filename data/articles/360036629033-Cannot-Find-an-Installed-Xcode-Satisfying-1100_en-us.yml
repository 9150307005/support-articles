body: "<p>If your Fastfile implements the\_xcversion action to find and select a specific version of Xcode, in this case Xcode 11, you may find the following error occuring:</p>\n<pre class=\"output\"><span class=\"pre\"><span class=\"white\"><span class=\"red\">[!] Cannot find an installed Xcode satisfying '11.0.0'</span></span></span></pre>\n<h3>Why does this happen?</h3>\n<p>The xcversion action in Fastlane uses the xcode-install gem behind the scenes and, currently as of Fastlane 2.131.0, the minimum version required by Fastlane is outdated.</p>\n<h3>Steps to Resolve</h3>\n<p>In your Gemfile, specify a newer version of xcode-install. At the time of writing, the latest version is 2.6.1:</p>\n<pre>gem 'xcode-install', '~&gt; 2.6', '&gt;= 2.6.1'</pre>\n<p>\_</p>"
