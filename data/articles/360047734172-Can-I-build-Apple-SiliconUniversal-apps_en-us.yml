  <p>Yes! Xcode 12 ships with both Intel and Apple Silicon tooling, so you can
  use our Xcode 12 image to build Intel, Apple Silicon and Universal apps.</p>

  <p>There are a few caveats to note:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Compilation times for Apple Silicon will be elevated due to the overheads
  of cross-compiling.</li>

  <li>Testing Apple Silicon apps is not possible as our fleet is entirely
  comprised of Intel Macs</li>

  </ul>

  <p>CircleCI is planning to add Apple Silicon hosts to out fleet in the future,
  however we do not have an ETA for this.</p>
