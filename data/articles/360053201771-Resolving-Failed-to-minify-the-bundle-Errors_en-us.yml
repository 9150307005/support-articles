  <p>The following error message is usually related to running out of memory
  during a job:</p>

  <pre class="css-1hjuxmj">Failed to minify the bundle. Error:
  static/js/12.fb78ba11.chunk.js from Terser

  Error: Call retries were exceeded</pre>

  <p>There are a couple of options to resolve this:</p>

  <ul>

  <li>Increase the <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#docker-executor"
  target="_self">resource class</a> in use to provide more memory to the
  job</li>

  <li>

  <a
  href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009208393-How-can-I-increase-the-max-memory-for-Node-"
  target="_self">Adjust the "max_old_space_size" for NodeJS to a suitable
  value</a>. For example, if you are using the medium resource class with 4GB of
  memory, then set this to 3GB.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>For additional visibility on memory usage issues, consider <a
  href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043994872-How-to-record-a-job-s-memory-usage"
  target="_self">logging the maximum memory usage</a> for the job.</p>
