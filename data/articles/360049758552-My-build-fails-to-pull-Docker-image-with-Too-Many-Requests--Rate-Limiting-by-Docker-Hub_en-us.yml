  <pre>-

  Beginning November 1, 2020, [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) has enabled
  rate limits based on the originating

  IP address. Since CircleCI runs jobs from a shared pool of IPs, it is strongly

  recommended to use authenticated Docker pulls with Docker Hub to avoid
  encountering

  rate limits.


  Identifying this error can be done by examining the `Spin Up Environment` step

  of your build output for a `toomanyrequests:Too Many Requests` error message.


  **Solutions:** 

  Using authentication for Docker Hub in your builds is the best way to avoid
  being rate limited for Docker image Pulls.

  The first suggestion is to create a
  [Context](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/) for your Docker Hub
  credentials to encorporate in your `config.yml`.


  Example config:

  You may also use a per-project Environment Variables as shown here.


  ![project-level-env-var](https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360071877271/project-env-var.png)


  Alternative soltuions can also be found here in our [Documentation
  here.](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images) 


  Below is an example of a build failure due to encountering the Docker

  rate limit.
