body: "<h3>Why is this happening?</h3>\n<p>If a job is not starting and showing a status \"<strong>Not Running</strong>\" after you triggered a pipeline, it means that you have reached the <strong>concurrency limit</strong> of your plan.</p>\n<p>This is most likely to happen to customers on our <a href=\"https://circleci.com/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Plan</a>, as they have access to use a single container at any one time (1x concurrency), therefore jobs will queue if that container is already in use.</p>\n<p>However, customers on plans with a higher concurrency limit can also encounter this situation.</p>\n<p>The delayed start of your job, and the fact it remains in a \"Not Running\" state before eventually starting, is due to the fact that other jobs are still running when the new job is triggered.</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<h3>Check for running SSH jobs</h3>\n<p>We found that this situation frequently arises due to running SSH jobs; once you navigate away from a running SSH job it won't appear in the pipelines view, <span>so one can assume</span> that no jobs are running at the time.</p>\n<p>SSH jobs, along with all jobs in a given project are listed in the \"<strong>legacy jobs view</strong>\":</p>\n<p><code style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3;\">https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/{vcs}/{org}/{project}/jobs</code></p>\n<p>An SSH job will remain available for an SSH connection for <strong>10 minutes after the job finishes</strong> - if SSH has not been accessed, then the job will <strong>automatically end after 10 minutes</strong>.</p>\n<p>After you SSH into the job, the SSH connection will remain open for <strong>up to two hours</strong>. That's why we advise to always manually cancel SSH jobs after you have finished with them to make sure your build queue is as free as possible.</p>\n<p>To do so, please follow instructions outlined in the Support article \"<a href=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047125652-How-to-see-running-SSH-jobs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to see running SSH jobs</a>\".</p>\n<p>\_</p>"
