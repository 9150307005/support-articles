body: "<p>\_If you're using the Docker executor, your image contents may change if you specify an image tag, such as `circleci/ruby:2.4-node` or `node:latest`. If you believe one of these images changed between two of your jobs, you can confirm this by comparing the image Secure Hashing Algorithm ID (SHA-256) in the two jobs. This is printed in the \"spin up environment\" section.</p><p><img src=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/115026605588/mceclip0.png\"></p><p>CircleCI and other image maintainers may introduce changes that change the contents of a tag like `2.4-node` or `latest`. Usually, this is done to fix bugs or introduce newer versions of essential software, like git and package managers for a language.</p><p>You can pin your job to run with a specific image SHA-256, which will guarantee the image won't change unless you update it yourself.\_This is done by removing the tag (e.g `latest`) and replacing it with the SHA-256 of the image, prefixed with `@sha256:`</p><pre class=\"line-numbers language-yaml\"><code class=\"config-yml  language-yaml\"><span class=\"token key atrule\">docker</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">  -</span> <span class=\"token key atrule\">image</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:\_</span></code>circleci/ruby@sha256:4be65b406f7402b5c4fd5df7173d2fd7ea3fdaa74d9c43b6ebd896197a45c448</pre>"
