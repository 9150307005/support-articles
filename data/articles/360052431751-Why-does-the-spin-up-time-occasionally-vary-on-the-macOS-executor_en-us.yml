  <p dir="auto">Slightly longer spin up times can occasionally occur with the
  macOS executor due to the way pre-scaling works. CircleCI automatically spins
  up a certain number of macOS VMs per image/resource class combination and the
  exact number varies depending on the demand we are seeing. Pre-scaling is
  always adjusting based on current demand and capacity availability, but it is
  not always able to predict spikes in demand.</p>

  <p dir="auto">If your job request is able to be fulfilled by a VM that is
  already booted up and ready to go, then you will see a very short spin up time
  - usually less than 30 seconds.</p>

  <p dir="auto">If, however, we do not have any VMs available at the time of the
  request, then we need to spin up a new VM and this can take up to a few
  minutes. Generally this is more likely to happen if you are using a less
  popular image/resource class combination as CircleCI will be pre-booting less
  of these.</p>

  <p dir="auto">This is normal behaviour and is something we constantly monitor
  closely. We cannot guarantee that there are enough pre-booted VMs for every
  job, but we do try to ensure this is the case as much as we can to provide a
  better customer experience.</p>

  <p dir="auto">If you find your jobs are consistently taking an excessive
  amount of time to spin up (more than five minutes), then please reach out to
  us on a support ticket so we can look into this further.</p>
