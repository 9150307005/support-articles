  <p>Currently, CircleCI does not have complete support for Apple Silicon as we
  do not host any Apple Silicon machines on CircleCI Cloud. Additionally, Apple
  Silicon is not officially supported by CircleCI Runner.</p>

  <p>With the current Intel hosts, you can still cross-compile for Apple Silicon
  which will allow you to build your apps as a "universal binary" on either
  CircleCI Cloud or Runner. The current suggestion is to export the binary as an
  artifact and test locally.</p>

  <p>We are working towards adding this support in the future, but in the
  meantime please vote and comment on the below feature request as this will
  allow us to gauge interest in this feature:</p>
