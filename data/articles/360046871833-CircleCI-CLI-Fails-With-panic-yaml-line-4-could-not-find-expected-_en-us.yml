  <p>Running various CircleCI CLI commands can fail with the error</p>

  <pre>panic: yaml: line 4: could not find expected ':'</pre>

  <p>This can be caused by a corrupted <code>~/.circleci/cli.yml</code> file. To
  resolve the issue, delete the contents of the <code>~/.circleci</code> folder
  and re-run setup.</p>

  <pre>rm ~/.circleci/*<br>circleci setup</pre>

  <p>You can then add a previous or newly created <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token"
  target="_self">Personal API Token</a>.</p>

  <p>If a similar error occurs when running <code>circleci validate</code>, but
  does not occur when running commands like <code>circleci version</code> or
  <code>circleci setup</code>, then this likely do to an error in the Orb YAML
  and is not related to a corruption of the <code>~/.circleci/cli.yml</code>
  file.</p>
