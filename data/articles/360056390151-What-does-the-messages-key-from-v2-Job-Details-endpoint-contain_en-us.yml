  <p>The <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#operation/getJobDetails"
  target="_self">Get Job Details endpoint</a> contains a <code>messages</code>
  key and you may wonder what sort of information should be present there.</p>

  <p>This key will provide error messages related to the build not running. It
  will return an empty array on both passing builds and builds that failed while
  running.</p>

  <p>As an example, take this build that didn't run:</p>

  alt="Screen_Shot_2021-01-22_at_9.06.57_AM.png"></p>

  <p>This is what would be returned from the API:</p>

  <pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">"messages" : [ {
      "type" : "warning",
      "reason" : "no-followers",
      "message" : "Your build was not run - reason code (no-followers)."
    }, {
      "type" : "error",
      "message" : "We did not test this push because nobody is following the project"
    } ],</pre>
