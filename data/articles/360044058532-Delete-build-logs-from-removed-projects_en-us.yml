body: "<p>Similar to Audit Logs, CircleCI retains build logs for up to one year based on the repository name. As a result, logging back in and re-setting up a project will retain the logs. In order to keep logs for both projects, we recommend you increment your repository name, i.e. <strong>project</strong> to <strong>project-1</strong> or in a way that best suits your needs.</p>\n<p>If you would like us to fully delete build logs associated with the project, please have an <a href=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034990033-Am-I-an-Org-Admin-\" target=\"_self\">organization admin</a> contact us at <a href=\"support@circleci.com\" target=\"_self\">support@circleci.com</a>\_to fulfill this request.</p>\n<p>If you would prefer to delete projects on your own rather than reaching out to Support, you can vote and comment and vote on an open feature request to support <a href=\"https://ideas.circleci.com/ideas/CCI-I-204\" target=\"_self\">project deletion in the UI</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Full project deletion is permanent and logs are unrecoverable once your request is complete.</p>"
