body: "<p>Historically we have installed the latest version of Node on our Xcode images, however as <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">noted by Node:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<em>LTS</em><span>\_release status is \"long-term support\", which typically guarantees that critical bugs will be fixed for a total of 30 months. Production applications should only use\_</span><em>Active LTS</em><span>\_or\_</span><em>Maintenance LTS</em><span>\_releases.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the above in mind, if you encounter any Node related issues, you may want to reference the\_Installed software for the Xcode image you are using to see the version of Node:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/testing-ios/#supported-xcode-versions\">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/testing-ios/#supported-xcode-versions</a></p>\n<p>As some of the newer images are using non-LTS versions of Node. You may need to manually adjust the node version in your configuration file if you need a specific version. You can install and use a different version of node <a href=\"https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/circleci/node\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">with the Node orb</a>. As an example:</p>\n<pre style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3;\">version: 2.1\n\norbs:\n  node: circleci/node@4.0.0\n\njobs:\n  test-and-build:\n    macos:\n      xcode: 11.0.0\n    steps:\n      - node/install:\n          node-version: \"13.11.0\"\n          ...</pre>\n<p>To adhere to their recommendation though, once the next LTS version is released we plan to pin all new generated Xcode images to the LTS version.</p>"
