body: "<p dir=\"auto\">\_</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">For security purposes we have found that Chrome will sometimes download a single file as a zipped file, usually when the file format is a mobile app -- i.e.\_<code>.ipa</code>\_or\_<code>.aab</code>.</p>\n<p dir=\"auto\">You have a few options to get around this and get the file itself:</p>\n<ol dir=\"auto\" type=\"1\">\n<li>You can utilize another browser besides Chrome, like Safari or Firefox.</li>\n<li>You can simply rename the file once downloaded from Chrome to have a\_<code>.ipa</code>\_or\_<code>.aab</code>\_file extension.</li>\n<li>You can right-click, then choose \"Save link as\", then when it prompts you -- change the format from \"Zip\" to \"All files\" and edit the filename to have the proper extension.</li>\n<li>A bit more involved, but you could specifically set the MIME type of the file within your job steps:\_<a href=\"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes</a>\_-- this should ensure the browser respects the type of file it is.</li>\n</ol>"
