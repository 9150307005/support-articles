  <p>Sometimes you'll see a blue banner on your build page indicating that there
  was an issue and the job was re-run automatically.</p>

  <p>These issues are not related to your project. Sometimes CircleCI will
  experience infrastructure failures, and in these instances, we will try to
  automatically start the job again. If you would like to rerun the job manually
  as well, you can always <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#rerunning-a-workflows-failed-jobs"
  target="_self">rerun jobs from the UI.</a></p>

  <p>If you notice this happening for an extended period on your project please
  submit a support ticket.</p>
