  <p>We do not have a direct endpoint for collecting this information, but you
  can often derive this from the `me` endpoint:</p>

  <p>https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/me</p>

  <p>This shows data from the currently logged in user or simply the user of the
  `circle-token` provided. If you use a token, be sure to make use of a
  [Personal API Token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/) as
  opposed to a Project Token.</p>

  <p>Within that API response, you will find the `projects` property. This will
  be a list of projects. The JSON object key will be the VCS URL. You can use
  that to filter to projects specifically within the desired organization.</p>
