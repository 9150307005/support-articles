  <p>Debugging where jobs spend most of their time can be useful to help
  optimise your pipeline, along with debugging spikes in job completion
  time.</p>

  <p>Generally, logging timing data is up to the command that is being run at
  the time, but we can manually add this by using some bash scripting.</p>

  <p>See the below example for how you can achieve this:</p>

  <pre>- run: example_command | while read line ; do echo "$(date +"%T") &gt;
  $line" ; done ;</pre>

  <p>This will provide and output along the following lines:</p>

  <pre class="css-1hjuxmj">21:15:46 &gt; Some Output Line 1

  21:16:12 &gt; Some Output Line 2

  21:17:41 &gt; Some Output Line 3

  </pre>

  <p>The format of the timing data is in HH:MM:SS which provides granular
  information that will help in tracking down steps that are taking longer than
  expected.</p>
