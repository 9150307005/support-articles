  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If your <em>Organization Settings</em> page
  states that your plan is managed by GitHub Marketplace, you must cancel your
  plan via GitHub.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because GitHub Marketplace is billed on a
  monthly basis, you will need to wait for your billing cycle to end before
  signing up on CircleCI. </span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have any further questions, please
  contact GitHub Support. You can learn more about CircleCI on GitHub
  Marketplace <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/circleci" target="_blank"
