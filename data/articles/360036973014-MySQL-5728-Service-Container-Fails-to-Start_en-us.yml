  <p><strong>MySQL</strong> was recently updated to 5.7.28 and <a
  href="https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues/600" target="_self">has a
  known issue with CircleCI</a>. If your jobs are pulling this version downgrade
  to using 5.7.27 specifically in your config. if you're using a minor version
  you should update to include the patch. mysql:5.7 would need to be updated to
  mysql:5.7.27 as well to prevent pulling the most recent patch version</p>
