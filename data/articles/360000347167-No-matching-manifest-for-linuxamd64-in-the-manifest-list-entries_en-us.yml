body: "<p>In the \"Spin up Environment\" step, or elsewhere when pulling a Docker image from a repository, you may run into an error similar to the following:\_</p>\n<pre class=\"output\"><span class=\"pre\"><span class=\"white\">Step 1/26 : FROM &lt;IMAGE&gt;\nlatest: Pulling from library/&lt;IMAGE&gt;\n</span><span class=\"white\">no matching manifest for linux/amd64 in the manifest list entries\n</span></span><span class=\"pre\"><span class=\"white\">Exited with code 1<br></span></span></pre>\n<p>There are three possible reasons for this error.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Error When Using \"Latest\" Tag</strong><br>While images are rebuilding on Dockerub, the \"latest\" tag will become momentarily unavailable while updating. This issue will resolve itself or can be mitigated by selecting a versioned tag.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>The Tag Is Not Available</strong><br>A tag that used to be available may no longer be listed or have had it's naming convention modified. A tag may have been \"Version8.0\" previously and became \"Version8.0.0\" recently.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Image Is Not Designed For x86, Such As ARM</strong><br>The image you are trying to build may be designed to run on a different architecture, such as an ARM-based\_CPU.</li>\n</ol>"
