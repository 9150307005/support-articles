body: "<p>Images based on the ARM architecture, such as <span>Raspberry Pi</span> images, can't natively run on an x86-based host which is what CircleCI uses.\_</p>\n<p>The binary files compiled for ARM-based images are not compatible with our hardware. Therefore, and so we will fail to communicate with the image once the Docker container is executed.<br><br>If you are developing for ARM, please tell us about it on <a href=\"https://ideas.circleci.com/ideas/CCI-I-900\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this CircleCI Ideas page</a>.</p>"
