  <p>When setting a <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-job"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">job level environment variable</a>, if the
  value is an integer and greater than 6 digits, we will convert it to an
  exponential number. As an example:</p>

  <pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1


  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
      environment:
        NUMBER: 7777777</pre>
  <p>The above would become instead <code>7.777777e+06</code> in the job. The
  reason for this conversion is how yaml interprets the value being passed.
  However, this can be avoided in a few different ways.</p>

  <h2>Store value as a string</h2>

  <p>Instead of setting the value as an integer instead set it as a string. So
  instead of <code>7777777</code> set it to <code>"7777777"</code> like
  this:</p>

  <pre style="background-color: #f3f3f3;">version: 2.1


  jobs:
    build:
      docker:
        - image: buildpack-deps:trusty
      environment:
        NUMBER: "7777777"</pre>
  <h2>Set the variable at the project level</h2>

  <p>Instead of setting the variable in your <code>config.yml</code> directly,
  you can instead <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">set the variable at the project level</a> to
  utilize in jobs. This will ensure the value is protected and not automatically
  converted.</p>
