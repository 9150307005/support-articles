  - convenience image
body: >-
  <p>The CircleCI convenience images (based on Ubuntu) for the Docker executor
  often come with apt package lists left over form the image build process.</p>

  <p>Over time these package lists become outdated and may contain urls that
  have since become invalid - in this case you will receive an error message
  along these lines:</p>

  <pre>E: Failed to fetch http://...../package.deb 404 Not Found<br>E: Unable to
  fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?</pre>

  <p>To resolve this, the package lists need to be updated by running the
  following command before installing any packages:</p>

  <pre>sudo apt-get update</pre>
