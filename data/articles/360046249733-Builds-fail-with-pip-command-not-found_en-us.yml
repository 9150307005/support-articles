  <p>Python 2 is no longer installed for macOS images from Xcode 11.4 onwards.
  This is due to homebrew deleting the Python 2 formula after it being
  deprecated for several years.</p>

  <p>The current workaround is to install the `pyenv` package from homebrew.
  This will link the `python` and `pip` commands to python 3.7 instead.</p>

  <pre>- run: brew install pyenv</pre>
