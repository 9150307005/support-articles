  <p>You're seeing the error:</p><p>&gt; failed to register layer: Error
  processing tar file(exit status 1): Container ID ... cannot be mapped to a
  host ID</p><p>Because that Docker image has one or more files owned by a Linux
  user with too high a UID/GID. You or the image maintainer will have to rebuild
  this image and ensure a user with a lower UID/GID owns those files. You can
  find more information [on this page in our docs](<a
