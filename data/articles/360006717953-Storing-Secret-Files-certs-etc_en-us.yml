body: "<p>There are few secret-storage options that CircleCI can support at this time:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can store them as plaintext using\_<a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contexts</a>\_resources (org-wide) or\_<a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars\" rel=\"nofollow\">environment variables</a>\_(job-specific), and then\_<code>echo</code>\_them into files, etc., at job runtime via your config.yml</li>\n<li>You can encrypt files and store them in your source repository, but store the decryption keys in CircleCI, again either via Contexts or job environment variables, and then decrypt as-needed at job runtime</li>\n<li>You can use a third-party secret storage solution (for example,\_<a href=\"https://vaultproject.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hashicorp's Vault</a>), so long as it has a headless CLI-accessible option that you can use in your CircleCI job (which Vault does)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For further questions or suggestions for your particular use-case, please contact <a href=\"mailto:support@circleci.com\">support@circleci.com</a>\_</p>"
