  <p>Just as you are able to debug CircleCI jobs by <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/ssh-access-jobs/">re-running them with
  SSH</a>, you can also debug within the <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/building-docker-images/">Remote Docker
  Environment</a> itself.</p>

  <p>To SSH into the remote Docker environment, run <code>ssh
  remote-docker</code> while SSH'd into any CircleCI job that uses
  <code>setup_remote_docker</code></p>

  <p>(Make sure the <code>setup_remote_docker</code> step completes first,
  otherwise your SSH command will fail!)</p>

  <p>For more information, we have an additional article on how to run commands
  in your <a
  href="https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009062913-How-do-I-run-commands-in-the-remote-Docker-environment-"
