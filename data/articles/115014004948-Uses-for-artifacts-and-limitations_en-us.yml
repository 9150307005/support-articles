body: "<p>If your build produces persistent artifacts such as screenshots, coverage reports, core files, or deployment tarballs, CircleCI can provide a link to download them. You can find them on the 'Artifacts' tab:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/115024993348/mceclip0.png\"></p>\n<p>The documentation for using artifacts is here:\_<a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/artifacts/</a></p>\n<p>Artifacts will be available for thirty days. If you're relying on them as a source of documentation / persistent content, we recommend deploying the output to a dedicated output target, such as <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\" target=\"_self\">GitHub Pages</a>\_or <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\" target=\"_self\">Netlify</a>\_for static websites.</p>"
