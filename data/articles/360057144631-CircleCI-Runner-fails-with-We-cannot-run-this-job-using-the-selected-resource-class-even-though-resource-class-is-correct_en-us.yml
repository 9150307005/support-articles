  <p>Customers may receive the following error when installing the CircleCI
  Runner</p>

  <pre>"We cannot run this job using the selected resource class. Please check
  your configuration and try again."</pre>

  <p>If you have verified that the namespace and resource class have been
  created correctly, the issue may be that the CircleCI Runner is not enabled
  for your plan.</p>

  <p>You can verify that the namespace and resource class have been created
  correctly with the following command in the CircleCI CLI. Replace
  "namespace-name" with the name of your namespace. You should see your resource
  class listed in the response.</p>

  <pre>circleci runner resource-class list namespace-name</pre>

  <p>CircleCI runner is currently only available if you are on the <a
  href="https://circleci.com/pricing" target="_self">Scale Plan</a>. Please
  reach out to your sales representative for information on how to sign up for
  the Scale Plan.</p>
