  <p dir="auto">This actually stems from the GitHub side of things:</p>

  <p dir="auto"><a

  <blockquote dir="ltr">

  <p dir="auto">Note: You will not receive a webhook for this event when you
  push more than three tags at once.</p>

  </blockquote>

  <p dir="auto">Since we rely on a GitHub webhook to trigger builds, and the
  above notes that one isn't generated when 3+ tags are involved, that is why
  you aren't seeing builds in CircleCI.</p>

  <p dir="auto">You will want to ensure you are only pushing up to three tags at
  a time if you want builds triggered within CircleCI.</p>
