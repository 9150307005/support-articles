  <p dir="auto">You may find that when your build output for a step reaches a
  certain size that the colour output is disabled for the whole build
  output.</p>

  <p dir="auto">This is an intentional feature which disables colours once the
  output reaches ~1000 lines for performance reasons.</p>

  <p dir="auto">Beyond this number of lines, the performance of the UI/build
  output can start degrading beyond an acceptable point which negatively affects
  the user experience.</p>

  <p dir="auto">This is the same reason why we do not display over a certain
  number of lines in the UI if the build output becomes too large.</p>

  <p dir="auto">It is not possible to override this default behaviour at this
  time.</p>
