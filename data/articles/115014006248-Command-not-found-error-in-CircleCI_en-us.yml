body: "<p>If you see something like this on CircleCI builds:\_</p>\n<p><code>/bin/bash: mongo: command not found</code></p>\n<p>This is because all of your commands will run in the first container that is listed (primary container). This is typically <strong>not</strong> the database container, which means that the\_<code>mongo</code>\_cli is likely not installed in the primary container. The same can happen for mysql and postgresql.</p>\n<p>In these cases you can install the client using <code>sudo apt install</code> or the relevant package manager for the distro your image is running.</p>\n<p>example:</p>\n<pre>- run: sudo apt-get install mongodb-clients</pre>\n<p>More details on Discuss here: <a href=\"https://discuss.circleci.com/t/bin-bash-mongo-command-not-found/16218/6?u=tom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://discuss.circleci.com/t/bin-bash-mongo-command-not-found/16218/6</a></p>"
