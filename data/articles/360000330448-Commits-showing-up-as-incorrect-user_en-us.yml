  <blockquote>GitHub uses the email address in the commit header to link the
  commit to a GitHub user. If your commits are being linked to another user, or
  not linked to a user at all, you may need to change your local Git
  configuration settings, add an email address to your account email settings,
  or do both.</blockquote>
