body: "<p>Nested teams within GitHub do not automatically inherit a parent team's context permissions. If a parent team is selected as a security group for a context, child teams are <strong>not</strong> automatically granted access.</p>\n<p>In order to grant a GitHub child team access to context, you will need to add the team as a security group for the context. If a child team is not listed as a security group you will get an \"Unauthorized\" error when triggering a build in CircleCI's UI (example below).</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360065231791/Screen_Shot_2020-08-18_at_10_20_11_AM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2020-08-18_at_10_20_11_AM.png\"></p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>\_</p>\n<p>For more information on contexts please refer to our official documentation:\_\_<a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/\" target=\"_self\">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/contexts/</a></p>"
