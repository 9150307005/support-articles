body: "<p>CircleCI automatically deletes branches when we receive a branch deletion event from your VCS provider (GitHub / Bitbucket).</p>\n<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> If you attempt to delete a branch while a job connected to that branch is still running, the branch will be re-created in CircleCI when the job is finished. Please allow all jobs running on a branch to finish before deleting it from the VCS provider to assure it will stay deleted.\_</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Articles:\_</strong><a href=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020298014-How-can-I-delete-branches-from-CircleCI-that-were-deleted-from-my-VCS-\" target=\"_self\">How to delete a branch after it is removed from the VCS.</a></p>"
