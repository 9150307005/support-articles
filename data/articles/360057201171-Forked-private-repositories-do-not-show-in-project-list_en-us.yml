  <p>When forking a private repository to another organization, the repository
  will not show up on the projects list for the downstream organization unless
  the original organization grants permission.</p>

  <p>As a workaround, you can recreate the repository under your organization.
  However, this will not allow you to pull down new changes from the original
  repository as it is not a fork.</p>
