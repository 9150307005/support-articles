body: "<p>One of the several uses of t<span>he <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CircleCI CLI</a> is to run jobs locally. However, it is currently not possible to add SSH keys using the\_<code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">add_ssh_keys</code>\_CLI command.</span></p>\n<p>Essentially, in this case, you'll need to pass some form of credentials into the container.</p>\n<h3>Basic authentication</h3>\n<p>You can set your VCS username/password as <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">environment variables</a>\_and pass them\_<span>to the CLI with the\_</span><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">-e</code><span>\_flag, for each variable.</span>\_This would allow you to clone the repository with <em>basic authentication</em>.</p>\n<h3>SSH key</h3>\n<p>Alternatively, you can base64-encode the private key\_and pass it into the job as an environment variable as well.<br>Then you can decode it into a file within a\_<code>run</code>\_command in your custom local config.<br>Once decoded into a file you can use\_<code>ssh-add -K path/to/key</code>. This would allow you access to the remote repository through <em>SSH key based</em> authentication.</p>"
