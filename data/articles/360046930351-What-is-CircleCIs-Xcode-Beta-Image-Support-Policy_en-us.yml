body: "<p>Beta images may include unknown bugs and blocking issues due to the nature of pre-release software, including Xcode and other third party software included in the images..</p>\n<p>We have a limited scope of support for issues directly relating to issues in beta versions of Xcode, please report issues with Xcode directly to Apple, either through the <a href=\"https://feedbackassistant.apple.com\" target=\"_self\">Feedback Assistant</a>, or via the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/forums/\" target=\"_self\">Apple Developer Forums</a>. If the issue is related to the macOS image itself, we will be happy to help.</p>\n<p><strong>Please note</strong>: As beta images are released, they are replaced in situ until a GM (stable) image is released, at which point the image is frozen and no longer updated.</p>\n<p>If you are requesting an image using an Xcode version that is currently in beta, please expect it to change when Apple releases a new Xcode beta with minimal notice. This can include breaking changes in Xcode which are beyond our control.</p>\n<p>We always announce image changes on our forum which you can find <a href=\"https://discuss.circleci.com/c/announcements/39\" target=\"_self\">here</a>\_- you can subscribe to this forum for updates by using the bell icon in the top right.</p>"
