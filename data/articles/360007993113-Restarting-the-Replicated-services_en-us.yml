  <p>Oftentimes, issues around installations refusing to stop/start, or upgrades
  failing, can be resolved by restarting the Replicated services:</p>

  <ol>

  <li>SSH into the Services machine</li>

  <li>run the following</li>

  </ol>

  <pre><code>$ sudo service replicated restart<br>$ sudo service
  replicated-operator restart<br>$ sudo service replicated-ui
  restart</code></pre>

  <p>This will cause the Management Console to refresh, but end users' running
  jobs will not be affected.</p>
