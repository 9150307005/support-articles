  <p><span>CircleCI Server does not yet support orbs natively. However, if you
  process your config prior to committing, orbs can be translated and
  used.</span></p>

  <p><span>The following workaround brings Orbs on CircleCI Server and mimics
  the flow that occurs in CircleCIâ€™s Cloud Product. In its most simplistic form,
  this workaround takes a version 2.1 configuration files and translates them
  into a version 2.0</span></p>
