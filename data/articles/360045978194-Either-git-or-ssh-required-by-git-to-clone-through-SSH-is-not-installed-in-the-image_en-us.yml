  <p>If you receive this error message while building with a custom image on
  CircleCI, it is because Git and SSH are required for CircleCI to work
  properly. If SSH and Git are missing from the container, the build agent will
  fall back to the native Git client, which may cause some issues. To resolve
  this error, install Git and SSH to the Docker image.</p>

  <p>If you receive this error on a CircleCI convenience image, please contact
  Support for assistance.</p>
