  <p>If the value you need to store in an environment variable contains a
  backtick (i.e. <code>`</code>) you will not be able to store it as a <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-project"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">project-level environment variable</a>.
  However, you can store the variable and value instead at either the <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-context"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">context level</a> or within the <a
  href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#setting-an-environment-variable-in-a-job"
  target="_blank" rel="noopener">job itself</a>. One note is that storing it at
  the job level is not secure and will expose the value within your
  configuration file.</p>
