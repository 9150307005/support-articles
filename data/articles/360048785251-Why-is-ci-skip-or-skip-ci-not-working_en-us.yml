body: "<p>We allow <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/skip-build/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">skipping a build in CircleCI</a> by passing either <code style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3;\">[ci skip]</code> or <code style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3;\">[skip ci]</code>\_<span>tag in the first line of the body of the commit or the commitâ€™s title.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, there are a few circumstances where this will not skip the build:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The build is associated with a forked PR</li>\n<li>The build is associated with a scheduled build</li>\n<li>The build is generated from the <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/#trigger-a-new-pipeline\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\"Trigger a new pipeline\"</a> API endpoint</li>\n<li>The build is triggered via a tag</li>\n<li>You include it at the end of a commit body that has more than 247 characters</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With the above in mind, to ensure builds are skipped, always try to include the tag in the subject of the commit or the very start of the commit body.</p>\n<p>If you need to skip a build triggered from the API you will want to consider implementing <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/pipeline-variables/#pipeline-parameters-in-configuration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">pipeline parameters</a>\_that you can pass when triggering the build that will flag the build not to run (think a boolean that defaults to <code style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3;\">true</code> and if you pass <code style=\"background-color: #f3f3f3;\">false</code> workflows won't run).</p>"
