body: "<p>Some testing processes may require that all test results be in a single file for processing. When working with parallel testing this could mean each container has it's own test results.\_</p>\n<p>Getting all the files to a single file can be accomplished with a new \"collection\" job. This would be a job that requires the parallel job and collects all the test reports from the parallel containers <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/configuration-reference/#persist_to_workspace\" target=\"_self\">through workspaces</a>.</p>\n<p>Then you can combine the files within that \"collection\" job and pass it through via workspaces to your last job/step -- or alternatively you can process them within the \"collection\" job itself as needed.</p>\n<p>\_</p>"
