body: "<p>You may see this if you're using Docker Layer Caching on the machine executor. When DLC is enabled on the machine executor the environment is persisted between builds. You'll need to manually stop running Docker containers that you've started to prevent naming conflicts between builds. This can be done in a run step at the end of your config.yml\_</p>"
