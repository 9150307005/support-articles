body: "<p>There are sometimes intermittent connectivity issues between us and other services on the internet. Every package manager server will experience some downtime.\_ Even if you can make a connection to them, their servers can fail in satisfying your request.\_ This includes npm and yarn, bundler, rubygems, pip, maven, composer, cocoapods, and the Android SDK.\_ We've had customers report network and server issues with all these tools.\_ There is not much that we can do to mitigate this except let the service owners know.\_</p><p>When you start seeing non-deterministic/flaky failures in your dependency setup, we suggest caching as many things as possible.\_ In most cases when you push code, you want to test your team or company's work, not network connections and third party servers.</p><p>In some cases, you may specifically want to test that your application can fetch all of its dependencies fresh, or update your dependencies and run your test suite against them.\_ For this, we suggest making a separate branch or job type specifically.\_ Users may also run this as a <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/#scheduling-a-workflow\">scheduled workflow</a>.</p><p>For more information, see: <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/\">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/caching/</a></p>"
