body: "<p>If you are <a href=\"https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/private-images/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">authenticating when pulling Docker images</a> and receive an error like the following on your \"Spin up environment\" step:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.circleci.com/hc/article_attachments/360072462692/Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_12.45.28_PM.png\" alt=\"Screen_Shot_2020-10-13_at_12.45.28_PM.png\"></p>\n<p>It means the username or password you are passing for authentication is incorrect.
